When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

A remote respository which never is pushed is effectively the same as a set of locally stored files. Nothing 
is really lost then (except a small amount of time) by making a project a remote repository. However, where one pushes that
remote  repository the files are now available on different machines.

The programmer who wants a way to conviently share a projects files, directory structure, and commit history probably will
find the remote repository to be a fantastic option. There are many situations where access to a repo accross many machines 
would be beneficial, such as for a public project where stakeholders would want to see the code, or for collaberation efforts
where teams can gain flexability through the ability to choose a work space for reasons other than necessity which is afforded
by the networking capabilities of remotes.
