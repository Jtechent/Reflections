What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

I do not really know what happens when you initialize a repository in a 
technical sense. However, I do know that git creates something that looks
at the directory in question (I assume any child directory files as well) 
and when in that directory git actions will be oriented on that set of 
files. It I assume treats that directories contents as a unit (a 
repository). 


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the 
repository? What value do you think it offers?

Staging area is a set of files. Working directory - Staging Area = untracted
files. Repository  - Staging Area = Repository | subset of Repository.

Working directory is simply the context of the Repo, Repository is the 
set of files being managed by git and their histories. Staging Area is a Set
 of files which git will add to the repo on the next commit.

Staging ground further refines the control offered by git commits. Allowing
the user to further mold what is commited, when.
